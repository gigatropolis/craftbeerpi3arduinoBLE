# craftbeerpi3arduinoBLE
Plugin for craftbeerpi3 that reads sensor input through Blue tooth light (BLE) from arduino device (nano 33 sense)

 Need to install bluez to rpi. It might be 80% there to just do:

 > sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez bluez-tools rfkill rfcomm

 some other resouces showing how to install from source.also more on dependencies and configuring bluetooth device on the Rasberry pi.
  Some files need to be modified to enable BLe (some of these resources may be old and so maybe not nessesary anymore)
